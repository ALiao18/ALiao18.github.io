# Curse of Dimensionality

The curse of dimensionality refers to various phenomena that arise when analyzing and organizing data in high-dimensional spaces.

For example, the volume of a unit ball \( V_n = \frac{\pi^{n/2}}{\Gamma(n/2+1)} \) shrinks relative to the unit cube.

- Distance metrics become less informative
- Sparsity increases exponentially
